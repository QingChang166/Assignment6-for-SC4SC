This is a description of what I did for homework 7.

1. create a git repo using git init.

2. add all files including input files and output files that are made by MakeFile using git add. This will put all files into the stages area.

3. commit all changes using git commit so that git will take a snapshot of the entire project and files in it.

4. after I create a new repo in github called Assignment7-for-SC4SC, I need to copy the repo address to further use in the git remote command.

5. then, use git remote add <name> <usl>, to connect to github. Here, the name I use is origin, and the url is the address I get from github.

6. use git push origin master to push all committed files in master to github repo.




Instructions for my co-author of how to clone and make the report:

1. the url for this project in github is https://github.com/QingChang166/Assignment6-for-SC4SC.git.

2. In your local computer, create an empty git repo using git init <directory>.

3. go to that directory using cd, and then use git clone https://github.com/QingChang166/Assignment6-for-SC4SC.git. This will download a folder name assignment6-for-SC4SC that contain all files.

4. to reproduce the report, run make in that folder and the paper.html will be the final output.
